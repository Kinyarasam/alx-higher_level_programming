# 0x06. Python - Classes and Objects

`Python`  `OOP`

## Background Context

OOP is a totally new concept for all of you (especially those who think they know about it :)). It's VERY important that you read at least all the material that is listed below (and skip what we recommend you to skip, you will see them later in the curriculum).

As usual, make sure you type (never copy and paste), test, understand all examples shown in the following links (including those in the vide0), test again etc. The biggest and most important takeaway for this project is: experimeenting by yourself OOP, play with it!

Read or watch the below resources in the order presented.

## Resources

#### Read or watch:
> * [Object Oriented Programming]() (Read everything until the paragraph _"inheritance"_ excluded. You do NOT have to learn about class attributes, *`classmethod`* and `_staticmethod_` yet)
